# ShowGo

## Problem Statement

I like to see live music, and once upon a time I found out about many shows through Facebook events, by following local bands and venues. Over the years I've spent less and less time on Facebook, and lost that easy way to find out about shows. I think there are a lot of people who used to use the big social media apps to explore their hobbies, and as more people leave those platforms we've seen a big rise in niche apps like Goodreads and Letterboxd, where you can explore a thing you care about without being bombarded by ads, sponsored content, photos of people you may have gone to high school with but aren't actually sure, etc.

My indie project will be for venues, artists, and concert goers to find each other. Venues can create events with the bands that are playing, and concert goers can follow those venues/bands to find out what shows they are hosting/playing. Users will also be able to see what shows are happening in a given city on a given day.
